# A view of Colombian Informal Workforce

[Video Presentation](https://vimeo.com/728143693)

## Overview 

The informal economy is one in which labor conditions do not follow a legal framework. Thus, it includes a series of productive activities where workers do not have rights such as vacations, compensation for working time, severance pay, among others. This kind of economy has a big role in emerging countries. It has been widely agreed that to measure its size is a challenge given unavailability of the data to describe and characterize the issue. Some efforts have been made to estimate the impact of informal economy in productivity or taxes revenue but it has been less explored its relationship with quality of life of those involved within. This phenomena entitles a social concern regarding the ability of societies to be resilient beyond measuring economic impact. 

## Definition 

Informal economy effects on quality of life measured by GEIH dimensions. Longitudinal study (2019-2021) of Barranquilla, Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín Metropolitan Areas. 

## Relevancy 

Given that the economy does not have sufficient capacity to integrate the growing workforce, there is a significant proportion of these people who move to the self-employment generation or underpaid jobs with no formal association, where working conditions are usually poor, there is exclusion from the social security system, insufficient income, among others.  

For those reasons, measuring the size of informality is key to understand the common struggles of the less favored population as well as being able to identify the demographic groups within this sector in order to predict vulnerabilities and common tendencies among cohorts or clusters. Therefore providing relevant information on the matter that can be used to mitigate this phenomenon and to uncover negative impacts on quality of life of the broader population allowing a better decisión making process by policy makers. 

## Datasets 

- [Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/MICRODATOS/about_collection/23).  DANE describes this dataset as one which:  

“Provides strategic information on the size and structure of the labor force (employment, unemployment and inactivity) of the country's population, as well as the socio-demographic characteristics of the Colombian population, allowing the population to be characterized according to sex, age, relationship with the head of household, educational level, affiliation to the social security health system, among others.” 

This dataset has been the main source of information to address informal economy related studies in Colombia. Data is divided into three main georeferenced categories which are Metropolitan areas, Urban populated zones and rural areas. 

The most important variables of the statistical operation are listed below and described by DANE (2021): 

- Housing: Type of housing and physical characteristics (material of walls and floors). 

- Household data: Connection to public, private - communal services, value paid for consumption and quality of the same, connection and use of sanitary service, obtaining water for consumption, place and energy for food preparation, garbage disposal, type of tenure of the dwelling, tenure of goods in the household. 

- Registration of persons: Identification of the usual resident. 

- General characteristics: Sex, age, relationship, marital status. 

- Social security in health: Coverage of the General System of Social Security in Health -SGSSS- by regime, person paying affiliation and coverage. 

- Education: literacy, school attendance, highest level of education attained and last year passed or in progress, and degrees or diplomas obtained. 

- Labor force: EAP (employed and unemployed). 

- Employed: 

- Main employment (branch of activity, occupation, type of contract, access to benefits, time worked and occupational position). 

- Wage earners (means of search, monthly remuneration, overtime, payments in kind, allowances, bonuses and bonuses). 

- Self-employed (forms of work, commercial registration, accounting, net profit or fees). 

- Salaried and self-employed (duration of employment, normal and effective hours worked, fees, size of the company, place of work, affiliation to pensions, family compensation fund and ARP, duration between previous and current employment). 

- Secondary employment (hours worked, occupational position, monthly remuneration, company size and place of work). 

- Employment with insufficient hours and situations of inadequate employment (by skills and income). 

- Quality of employment 

- Unemployed: duration of job search, work history, income and social security. 

- Inactive: work history, income and social security. 

- Other activities. Unpaid activities and assistance 

- Other Income. Income other than labor income. 

- Fertility. Number of children born alive and the influence of paternity or maternity on the labor market. 

- Migration. National migration dynamics of the target population. 

- Child labor. Activities and reasons for child labor 

- Job training. Dynamics of training for work, its characteristics and participation in competency certification processes at the national level of the target population. 

## Goal: 

Create a demographic and spatial analysis of informal economy as predictors of quality of life in Urban Areas.
